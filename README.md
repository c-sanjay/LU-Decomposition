# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Define the package as scipy.linalg import lu.
2. Get input from user and print L and U matrix by 'print' .
3. Define a package as "from scipy.linalg import lu_factor, lu_solve" and  create the variable as 'X' include the package in that variable.
4. print the variable 'X'

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
```py
'''Program to find L and U matrix using LU decomposition.
Developed by: SANJAY C
RegisterNumber: 23013498
'''
from scipy.linalg import lu
import numpy as np
arr=eval(input())
A=np.array(arr)
P,L,U=lu(A)
print(L)
print(U)
```


(ii) To find the LU Decomposition of a matrix
```py
'''Program to solve a matrix using LU decomposition.
Developed by:SANJAY C 
RegisterNumber: 23013498
'''

# To print X matrix (solution to the equations)
from scipy.linalg import lu_factor,lu_solve
import numpy as np
arr=eval(input())
c=eval(input())
a=np.array(arr)
b=np.array(c)
r=lu_factor(a)
sol=lu_solve(r,b)
print(sol)
```

## Output:
![lu decomposition](./1.png)
![lu decomposition](./2.png)


## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
